# Grantmaking

<https://80000hours.org/career-reviews/grantmaker/>

## Pathway

Build object-level expertise and/or a good network -> Get into a position where theyâ€™re trusted by the major funders (which requires having some kind of relevant track record). -> Distribute funds

## Estimation strategy

1. Estimate your chances of getting into this career path
2. Estimate how much money you would get trusted with (in dollars)

- Split this into "advisor" roles, which seem easier to get into but which would affect less money, and "officer" roles, which are more difficult to get into but which would get more money.

3. Estimate how long your grantmaking career would last
4. Estimate the value of grantmaking as a multiple over GiveDirectly donations.
