> Someone with the right profile, idea, and plan could plausibly be given several hundred thousand dollars fairly quickly to test out their idea, with the potential to scale that to tens of millions of dollars per year within several years if itâ€™s promising after testing.

## Pathway to impact

Write blogposts, display good judgment, socialize -> Attain the trust of funders or those whom funders trust -> Get funding -> Create an organization -> Solve or mitigate an important problem.

## Estimation strategy

1. Estimate chance of obtaining funds
2. Estimate chance of getting an organization off the ground
3. Estimate the impact of the hypothetical organization in terms of a multiplier over GiveDirectly
4. Add a shapley multiplier (penalizes paths to impact with long chains)
