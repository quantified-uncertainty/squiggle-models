Time estimate: A few days.

These are all really shitty estimates. I would give them 0.5/5 stars. Maybe with aggregation, they could reach 1/5 stars.

I expect there to be eggregious errors here, of the sort "woops, this variable is off by five orders of magnitude"

And yet, after criticism.

Bounties: $50, if you produce an estimate that I choose to aggregate. $50 if you improve any one variable in these estimates, $50 if you produce a different composition.

Something that worries me is that these pathways to impact may have different filters, and I'm only seeing some of them. How many steps.

Also varying wildly by ability.

Personal fit estimates.

To do:

- Varyingv wildly by ability. Have adjustment estimates.
