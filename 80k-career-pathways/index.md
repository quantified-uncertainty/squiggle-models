## Extremely rough impact estimates of top five 80,000 hours career paths.

This blogpost presents some very, very, very shitty estimates of the impact of the top five 80,000 hours career paths. I have an intuitive scale for the quality of estimates; these estimates would rate an Amazon review 0.5/5 stars.

I expect these estimates to have eggregtious errors, of the sort "woops, this variable is off by five orders of magnitude". Something that worries me in particular is that I'm considering different numbers of steps for each pathways, but some pathways have steps I may not consider.
