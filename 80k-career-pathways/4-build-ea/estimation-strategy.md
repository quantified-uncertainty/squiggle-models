## Pathway

I see two distinct pathways to impact:

- Go to a top uni -> Contribute to a university group -> Attempt to recruit some people into EA
- Attain skills that CEA needs -> Get hired by CEA -> Produce some multiplicative impact over CEA's activities

These are somewhat distinct. I think the 80,000 hours article is mostly talking about the second. But due to time constraints I'll estimate the

## Estimation strategy

1. Estimate the number of EAs one could counterfactually incorporate
2. Estimate the chance that these EAs become "highly engaged"
3. Estimate the chance that a "highly engaged EA" does something valuable
4. Estimate the value of that, in QALYs
5. Estimate the counterfactual value that people would have otherwise produced.

Particularly the later two estimates are particularly uncertain. That is, I just came up with a distribution that seems valuable. But to get a distribution that looks reasonable I would have to estimate the distribution of what EA people work on, and their value, which seems like too much work for a casual post.
